[Necklace Generator](https://f23-cs131-yuen-17240.github.io/DL_Project_Yeunha_Kim/)

### generate.js

This file contains the main javascript function that calls getBracelets or gerNecklace based on user inputs.

### getBracelets.js

The function getBracelets returns a 2D array, where each sub array represents a single unique arrangement.

### getNecklaces.js

The function getNecklaces returns a 2D array, where each sub array represents a single unique arrangement.

### linearFinite.js and linearInfinite.js

While these are not really important functions of the project, I decided to include these two files as well, since I used it as a part of the presentation.
